# 🏠 Kathmandu House Price Predictor

This project is a **machine learning-powered house price prediction system** built using **Python, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit**. It predicts the price of houses in Kathmandu based on user-defined property attributes.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Predicts house prices using a trained **Random Forest Regressor**
- Real-time web UI built using **Streamlit**
- Encodes location data using **Label Encoding**
- Clean preprocessing: removes unnecessary and unused features
- Includes trained model and label encoder saved via **joblib**
- Easy-to-use inputs: Location, Land Area, Road Access, Floors, Bedrooms, Bathrooms, and House Age

## 📊 Dataset

- Source: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nishanpokh/house-price-dataset-nepal)
- Preprocessing steps:
  - Manual Row Cleaning of Irrelevant Data(such as `RENT` `Rs. X /m` and `Rs. XX / aana`)
  - Cleaned `PRICE` column by removing symbols and characters
  - Dropped irrelevant columns like `FACING` and `BUILT YEAR`
  - Encoded `LOCATION` using `LabelEncoder`

---

## 🧠 Model Training

We used a **Random Forest Regressor** for its robustness and high accuracy with tabular data.

### 📁 `train_model.py`

```bash
- Drops columns: ['FACING', 'BUILT YEAR']
- Cleans PRICE column using regex
- Encodes LOCATION using LabelEncoder
- Splits dataset (80% train / 20% test)
- Trains RandomForestRegressor with 100 trees
- Saves model as `house_price_model.pkl`
- Saves encoder as `location_encoder.pkl`
```

**R² Score Achieved:** ~0.67 (decent predictive performance)

## 💻 Streamlit Web App

### 📁 `app.py`

The frontend is a simple yet intuitive Streamlit app.

#### Inputs:
- 📍 Location (dropdown)
- 📐 Land Area (sqft)
- 🚧 Road Access (feet)
- 🏢 Floor Count
- 🛏️ Bedrooms
- 🛁 Bathrooms
- ⏳ House Age (in years)

#### Output:
- ✅ Predicted Price (formatted in Rupees)

#### Example:
> Estimated House Price: Rs. 23,50,000.00
